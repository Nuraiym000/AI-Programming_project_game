# AI-Programming_project_game

Hi, everyone!

My name is Nura, I'm AI student, and this is my first computer programming project

I'm making my favourite game - Tetris, Let's start then 

Our first step is to set up a project:
1. Create a repository 
2. Activate a venv:
~ python3 -m venv venv
~ . venv/bin/activate
3. Create requirements.txt and install library, modules, in our case it is Pygame, 
we are making a game using this cross-platform set of Python modules
~ pip install -r requirements.txt
4. Initialized git repository and pushed it to my repository by using simple commands
~ git init (initialize a local Git repository)
~ git remote add origin 'SSH' (add a remote repository)
~ git add (add to the staging area)
~ git commit -m "commit message" (commit changes)
~ git push origin 'branch name' (push a branch to your remote repository)
